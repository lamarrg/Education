# terminal_blog

This is a simple app for the terminal that allows users to create blogs, and to read/write entries.

I did mine a little different, I used an external mongodb implementation through mlab.com instead of installing directly on my system. (Since I can't install mongodb in a virtual environment, I thought this would be better. details are in my secure data file.)

(This app was built with python 3.6)
