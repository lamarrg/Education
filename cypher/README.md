This item is from edX, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-research-harvardx-ph526x" target="_blank">Using Python for Research</a>.

It is the homework for week three, a case study of how to convert data for DNA research. 

My code works, it gets the same result that they request, it just does it in a different way. I attempted to submit my code, but it was not being accepted by the system. 

The exercise is actually hosted on <a href="https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/using-python-for-research/case-study-1-caesar-cipher?ex=1" target="_blank">DataCamp</a> I decided to not post the code that DataCamp uses, but rather link to the exercise. (I do not want to post the answers!) I will say the ultimate expected outcome is... klcpacqdphclvcfdhvdu
